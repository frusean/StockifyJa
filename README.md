 ** Project Description:**
 Apple Nova is a B2B supplier of Apple electronics in bulk in Jamaica. They are in  need of an inventory management system that will allow for tracking of products purchased and sold by them. 
 This would be in the form of a desktop application that allows their retailer partners/clients to access this software to place bulk orders and view inventory, among other things.

 Customers will interact with View All Products, Place Order, Order Summary, Payment and Live Chat forms. 
 Administrators will interact with Manage Users, Products, Orders, Supplies, Settings, Reports and Live Chat forms.
